# Hi, there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Darren
I'm an aspiring full-stack web developer from Greater Manchester. I have just completed a 13 week Bootcamp at Northcoders. I am now looking for a position as a junior developer.

At Northcoders, I gained experience in backend development, front end development and test-driven development. The course covered a wide range of topics; JavaScript, Express, PostgreSQL, React, HTML, CSS, Jest, git and node.

**Northcoder Projects**
- Backend RESTful API for a news website using test-driven development.
- A React user interface for displaying data from a backend API.
- A React Native mobile application for tracking food expiration dates.
